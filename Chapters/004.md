Chapter 4
==========================

They used the slate to travel up to the tower the next morning, using the higher vantage point to scout their intended route. Just beyond the plateau, ruins stretched along a road, leading from the base of the plateau to a river delta in the distance, where one of the tributaries curved out of sight between the Dueling Peaks. Another Sheikah Tower lay just at the edge of clarity, almost lost in the haze of distance and the shadow of the peaks but for its bright orange glow. The ruins appeared clear of monsters, though both girls readily acknowledge the abundant places one might hide in ambush.

"Straight down the middle?" Link asked. "Shall we explore the ruins, or see how far our paragliders get us?"

"Link," Zelda whined. "How could you make me choose like that!?" She grinned, and continued. "Let's get as far as we can. I for one am hoping for a proper bath when we reach the village. If we really want to explore the ruins, we can always just have the slate bring us back."

Their gliders carried them nearly to the foot of the bridge, whooping gleefully, where they found the Bosh Kala shrine tucked away nearby. Monk Bosh Kala did not have a new power for the slate, but the shrine's challenge did give them quite a bit of practice with their paragliders.

A light drizzle had just ended when they emerged, and the stone of Proxim Bridge was slick with water. Halfway across, they met their first Hylian (who wasn't a spirit, anyway). A man was standing just before the far end of the bridge, leaning against a spear and staring over the water to the west.

"The end is near..." He muttered as they approached, though he hadn't noticed them yet, or hadn't acknowledged them at any rate.

Zelda couldn't help herself. "What do you mean?" She asked the man, startling him.

"I may be somewhat used to seeing bad omens by now, but that... Well, let's just say it's badder than most," he replied absently, before turning and shouting, "we're doomed! I mean, don't panic! Sorry, who are you? Have we met?"

Zelda shook her head, wide-eyed, as Link stifled a giggle.

"Well, doesn't matter who you are, really. I was getting tired of talking to myself, so you've come at a good time. By the by, those strange things that popped out of the ground... Did you see them?" At Zelda's blank look, he elaborated. "I'm not talking about mushrooms here! I'm talking about those towers! They seem to have popped up all over the place! And that's not the only strange thing that's happened. Those long-deserted shrines suddenly started glowing! You know what this means, don't you? The end is here!" He shrieked this last with a manic gleam in his eye, making both girls jump.

"We, um, we'll keep that in mind," Link said, dragging Zelda away.

"That was... concerning," Zelda said once they were out of earshot.

"What, don't tell me you believe him?" Link asked, incredulous.

"What? No, of course not," Zelda scoffed. "But if his reaction is typical, I despair of finding much in the way of preserved knowledge."

"Let's hope it's not typical, then," Link replied, "or we'll _really_ have our work cut out for us."

+++++

They passed another bokoblin camp, giving it a wide berth, before coming across a fallen tree trunk of truly impressive girth -- Zelda measured 16 paces across. It was hollow all the way through, and made for a surprisingly serviceable ramp up the hillside. At the top, on the remains of the over-sized tree stump, they stopped for lunch and to plan their next moves, now that they were past the bend in the river.

"Looks like we'll have to cross the river to reach the next tower," Link commented. "It looks rocky, and sort of shallow. We might be able to wade across there."

"We could," Zelda mused. "_Or!_ We could hike up that hill behind us and glide over!"

Link grinned, knowing exactly which option Zelda preferred. And how could she disagree, when Zelda's eyes sparkled like that? Besides, gliding was too much fun to pass up a chance like this.

+++++

The Dueling Peaks Tower, as the slate named it, not only added a new regional map, but something called a Sheikah Sensor, which made the slate vibrate based on proximity to shrines. It began vibrating almost immediately, and as they glided up the Squabble River between the Dueling Peaks, they found the Ree Dahee shrine.

"At least back-tracking is easy enough," Zelda commented, once its travel gate was registered. "Let's press on, though. I'd rather not camp for the night in this canyon."

Link agreed. "Far too many monsters around." She'd spotted another bokoblin camp on the near side of the river, so when they continued on, they made sure to land on the far side. There was still a sentry to contend with at the footbridge at the end of the canyon, but when it was dispatched, Link found to her delight that it had been carrying shock arrows. And just beyond the footbridge was another shrine -- Ha Dahamar -- and the _strangest_ building either of them had yet seen. It looked like a yurt, at ground-level, but perched atop it was a gigantic sculpture of a horse's head, made from bits of scrap wood and metal, and draped with brightly-colored flags. The grounds surrounding the yurt were scattered with stacks of crates and sundry; seating areas; cook-fires; and various animals wandered about. Horses were stabled to one side, and a corral of goats grazed in back.

As they approached, putting off the shrine for morning, a man called to them.

"Welcome to Dueling Peaks Stable!"

+++++

They sold some of the opals they'd found on the plateau to pay for beds that night. The beds being the most comfortable either could remember ever sleeping on -- though, having proper memories dating back less than a week, all of it spent definitively "roughing it," that was a low bar. In spite of that, both girls slept fitfully, finding the distance between them unpleasant and the sounds of other people distracting.

Waking early the next morning, they had a lazy breakfast at the communal cook-fire before tackling the shrine. Another traveler, who introduced herself as Sagessa, told them about elixirs, and Zelda chattered excitedly about the possibilities and experiments she wanted to try as they continued on their way.

The road became steep after the Kakariko Bridge, winding along Lake Siela before becoming enclosed on either side by steep cliff walls. Eventually, just after noon, they passed under a series of gates hung with blue banners bearing the Sheikah eye and a few other glyphs neither understood. They were stopped at the village gate by an old woman who'd fallen and hurt her ankle, and after they helped her up, she directed them to Impa's house, and they got their first look at a proper village.

Kakariko was beautiful.

Elegantly-constructed houses and shops wound through a hollow in the cliffs, laid out among waterfalls and rivulets, with well-maintained wooden bridges allowing foot traffic. Ropes crossed overhead, hung with paper lanterns and wooden wind-chimes that sang gently in the breeze. Trees and gardens were everywhere, willows and ginkgo and even a grove of pink-blossomed plum trees. As they descended into the village proper, a tiny ball of energy in the shape of a child ran up to them.

"Hi, I'm Cottla! When's food? I'm bored! Wanna play?"

"Um..." Zelda stammered.

"Not right now, kiddo, sorry," Link cut in, to Zelda's relief. "We have to go see Impa first. Maybe later, okay?"

"But I'm _bored!_" Cottla whined, stamping her foot. "Ugh! Fine. See you later!" She ran off, leaving Zelda blinking in her wake.

"What just happened?"

Link could only laugh.

+++++

Impa's house, as befit the village elder, was right in the middle of the village, facing a wide gathering area, opposite a small pond featuring a small statue of Hylia, and framed by two waterfalls flowing into a larger pond surrounding the house. It sat perched atop a wooden platform itself perched on a spit of rock jutting out into the pond. A long staircase led up to the house proper, and two Sheikah men stood guard at the gate.

"You there!" One shouted, stopping them as they approached the stairs. "Who are you!? How dare you trespass upon Lady Impa's abode-!" He cut himself off. "Is that... a Sheikah Slate? But that would mean you are... No, it's not possible. Can it be?"

"Way to let a lady get a word in edge-wise," Zelda muttered.

The second guard cleared his throat, shooting an admonishing glare at his counterpart. "Please, forgive us for behaving so rudely," he apologized. "Of course we have heard the legends from Lady Impa herself. Please, friends, go ahead and step inside." He pulled the other guard along to let them pass.

"Thank you," Zelda said primly as they ascended.
