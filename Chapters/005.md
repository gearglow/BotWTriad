Chapter 5
============================

They stayed in Kakariko for a few more days, training with Paya and gathering supplies for their journey to Hateno. They spoke with some traveling merchants to get an idea as to the condition of the road, and were advised to acquire horses -- once past the Wall, monsters were plentiful until the village and camping was dangerous. On foot, the journey would take them two days, but a horse could make the trip in one. As they would need to backtrack most of the way to the Dueling Peaks stable to reach the Hateno Road anyway, Impa advised them to stay the night there and catch some wild horses.

"Surely they'll be valuable assets for your quest," she said. "They _love_ carrots, you know! You might buy a handful or two from Trissa before you leave."

That got Zelda worrying about money, though. "Link, we only have 67 rupees, and the stablemaster said it was 20 rupees per horse. And we'll need to stay at the inn for who-knows-how-long once we get to Hateno, not to mention paying Ollie" -- the innkeeper at the Shuteye Inn --  "for tonight. Will we have enough?"
