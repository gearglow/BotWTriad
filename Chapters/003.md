Chapter 3
==========================

"Where to next?" Link asked, as they appeared atop the tower.

Zelda peered through the slate's scope. "It looks like there's a cabin in those woods beyond that monster's territory," she replied. "Maybe they can help us get to the other two shrines. I don't like our chances dealing with that kind of cold right now."

Link glanced at the screen over her shoulder. "If we circle around the far side of the temple we should be able to avoid getting that beast's attention. And if we transport to the shrine where we woke up, we won't need to climb down from here."

They suited action to words, stopping by the pond for a quick lunch of freshly-caught fish, and made their way along the west wall of the temple.

"I still can't believe you caught those fish with your bare hands!" Zelda said as they left the pond behind.

Link shrugged. "I don't think they know enough to be wary. Didn't a few swim right into your pouch yesterday?"

"That's true, I suppose," Zelda replied. "But still, it was rather impressive of you."

They paused at the bottom of the slope. To their left, far enough away that it hadn't noticed them, was the large quadrupedal monster. On their right was another encampment of the smaller bipedal monsters, complete with a lookout on its tower. And directly ahead, atop a small rise and just past a large boulder, was the cabin Zelda had spotted. They made a dash for the boulder, circling past and avoiding the monsters, to find none other than the old man, sitting on a log by a cook-fire in front of the cabin.

"Oho!" He greeted them. "Fancy that! So we meet again."

"Hello there!" Link waved. "You look as if you're trying to remember something."

"Very astute," the old man agreed. "These old bones aren't what they used to be. I created a dish, you see, not long ago, made with spicy peppers to keep me warm. It's much less itchy than a doublet, but for the life of me I can't remember the recipe. I could swear I wrote it down," he grumbled in consternation.

"What did you name the dish?" Zelda asked curiously.

"Spicy meat and seafood fry," the old man replied absently. "I gathered some spicy peppers yesterday, and a boar this morning, but I forgot what else I needed."

Zelda cocked an eyebrow. "Might the missing ingredient be a fish of some sort?" She asked dryly.

"Oh!" Link exclaimed. "May I?"

The old man nodded, gesturing to where the meat and peppers were, already sliced. "By all means! If you can help me with this recipe, I'll gladly give you each a warm doublet, and be glad of it! Never did like how the wool itches," he trailed off.

Zelda handed a fish to Link, who promptly gutted, cleaned, and de-boned it before throwing all the ingredients into the cook-pot with a few crushed herbs. Zelda dutifully wrote down the recipe as Link completed each step, handing it to the old man once the dish was done.

"Wonderful!" He cried joyfully. "It smells divine. One moment." He stood with a creak, ducking inside the cabin for a moment before returning with a thick woolen bundle. "I scavenged these, and some others, from the abbey ruins an age ago. I do believe they'll serve you well. And speaking of, how goes the treasure hunt?"

"It's progressing," Zelda replied. "We were just wondering about the best route up the mountain."

"Well," the old man replied, "if memory serves there's an old path along the River of the Dead -- named because the water's dead cold!" He chuckled. "You'll still need to do some climbing, of course, but the way to both shrines is much less steep from that side. Be careful, though -- the bokoblins seem to love it up there."

"Bokoblins?" Zelda asked. "Is that what those little monsters are called?"

"With big heads?" The old man confirmed. "Indeed they are. Vicious little creatures, but not very bright. Still, they swarm."

"Lovely," Zelda muttered.

"What about that big one past the trees, by the abbey?" Link asked.

"Ah, the lynel," the old man replied somberly. "Stay well away from them. You won't find a more dangerous beast than that shy of the great molduga of the Gerudo desert, nor more cruel. And what's more, they breathe fire."

Link and Zelda stared at each other with wide eyes.

"Now," the old man continued. "If you'd like to get in some practice dealing with those bokoblins before venturing up the mountain, that bunch down the ravine have kept me from my stash of bomb-arrows. If you can clear those vermin out, the arrows are yours."

"We won't be able to avoid them forever," Link shrugged.

"And we'll have the high ground," Zelda added. "Alright. No time like the present."

They stealthily made their way to the edge of the ravine, where Link managed to daze the lookout with her first arrow, knocking it from its perch. It stood, shaking its head and smacking itself in the face with its ridiculous floppy ears, then settled where it fell and began looking around.

"Not too bright, are they?" Zelda murmured.

"Lucky for us."

They sent a hail of arrows into the creature, quickly felling it, and set their sights on the three dancing around a fire some ways off.

"More crates for cover," Zelda murmured. "I can't get a bead on them with that other tower in the way."

They stole carefully down the end of the ravine, creeping up behind the rotted old crates.

"All their weapons are against that log over there," Zelda observed quietly. "I'll sneak over and steal them while you cover me."

She darted out at Link's nod, managing to stuff the last of them in a pouch before she was noticed.

Link's first arrow went wide, but distracted them long enough for Zelda to draw her sword and shield and put the log between her and the bokoblins. Then she drew their attention back as Link drew her own sword, swinging it around like a shot-put as she advanced. The bokoblins, bereft of weapons, responded with thrown rocks and fists and teeth, but were swiftly dispatched with only a few scrapes and bruises to show for it.

Link checked the crates in passing, and whooped with joy. Not only were there another short-sword, a spear, and a proper shield, but she'd finally found some flint! Zelda laughed at her exuberance, getting a bashful grin out of the other girl that made her blush.

Behind some shoddy wooden planks leaned against the mouth of a small cave on the far side of the camp, they found the bomb arrows -- and above them, a hive of courser bees. Even as they watched, the hive fell from where it had hung, shaken loose by their moving the planks, and the bees began to swarm, chasing them back out of the cave as they flailed around them with their shields. Eventually, the bees flew off, leaving behind a few stings and an entire hive full of honey and beeswax.

_Worth it,_ Link decided, even as she carefully scraped the stingers out.
