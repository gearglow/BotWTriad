Notes
=======================

Plot Points:
---------------

- Link and Zelda awaken in the Shrine of Resurrection together. Link is dismayed to "be a boy" and Zelda says "well, we'll just have to fix that, then."

- At some point after everyone keeps telling them about how they need to take up the mantles of their past lives and seal away Ganon, Zelda goes off: 

    > "_Sealing_ power! _Sealing_ sword! None of you even know what those really are! You're all so intent on forcing us into roles you don't even understand, and look where that got us!" 

    > "Maybe," Link said quietly into the shocked silence that followed, "it's time we become who we actually are instead of who everyone thinks we should be."

- They stay in Kakariko for awhile so Zelda can learn to fight better. Up to then Link's done most of it, and though Zelda's not completely helpless (and is in fact a natural) she's undisciplined.

- Paya grows more comfortable around them pretty quickly, and Impa more-or-less orders her to accompany Z and L on their journey. She doesn't argue much.

- They make for Gerudo Town after Zelda remembers Urbosa at the Lanayru Road's East Gate. They manage to escape the blue-maned lynel, and realize that martial prowess isn't going to be enough. Aside from everything else, maybe they'll be able to learn some battle-magic like Urbosa's.

- In each place, they learn different magic. Link specializes in transformation magic and healing. Zelda specializes in elemental conjuring and utility spells. Paya specializes in illusion and defensive magics. They all pick up some enchanting too, mostly from Purah and from wheedling it out of the monks in the shrines (especially Maz Koshia).

- Link convinces Purah to work on a rune to reshape her body.

- Dismayed that the Gerudo will probably think her a voe and not let her in, Link sits up on the roof of the inn at Kara Kara Bazaar one night and meets Vilia, who teaches her how to make estrogen cream from an extract of pregnant mare urine, beeswax, and aromatic herbs to overpower the uric smell. She also sells her some Gerudo garb with a veil in the meantime, which causes quite a lot of gender euphoria in Link and quite a lot of blushing on Paya and Zelda's part.

- Link learns enough transformation magic from Mipha's notes (and her spirit, after freeing Vah Ruta) to help her HRT along, and also a few other changes (higher voice, no unwanted hair).

- Gear: Paya uses Impa's old paraglider. Link and Zelda have their old ones returned to them by Rhoam's ghost. Maz Koshia ends up having a few spare Sheikah Slates, so by that point all three of them have their own (with Master Cycle runes, naturally).

- The Master Sword will allow all three of them to wield it, but Zelda is the one who can hear Fi.

- The spirits of the four Champions were the ones holding back Ganon for the last century. When it senses that Z and L are awake and the Sheikah Towers are activated, it manages to get the Blights through the Champions' defenses once more and retake the previously-deactivated divine beasts. As the trio free each one, its Champion grants them their magic before retaking their position at the helm.

- Reeling from the defeat of the Blights, Ganon retreats into its own, corrupted version of the Shrine of Resurrection to regain strength before the inevitable showdown. This gives the trio enough time to complete Maz Koshia's trials and come into their own before the final battle.

- The trio make an excursion into the castle well before the final battle to raid the library. Among the secret alcoves they find volumes on lost magic and witchcraft. They find instructions for crafting flying brooms, and Zelda of course wants to try making other types of flying conveyances. Purah is ecstatic.

- Maz Koshia's "shrine" is the Great Hub, the generator and master relay for all of the Sheikah tech throughout Hyrule. It's also the central repository for all of the ancients' knowledge, and is lined with the same material as was used to create the Ocarina of Time, and so time can be stretched or compressed within its confines. It's also why time passes so strangely inside the shrines.


Character Profiles
-----------------------

### Link
Trans girl. Hero of Wisdom.
In her past life, she was Zelda's appointed knight and bearer of the Master Sword. She never had the chance to do anything about transitioning, so history knows her old self as a boy. She was taciturn to a fault, and tended to either stand aloof or throw herself into recklessness in overcompensation. It's a life she's glad to be rid of, aside from the people she's lost.
In her new life, thanks to the encouragement of her friends (Zelda and Vilia in particular) she's an aspiring mage and healer. She's much more open and friendly, while also being calmer and somewhat soft-spoken. She's still a fierce fighter when necessary, and a steadfast companion to Zelda and Paya always.

### Zelda
Cis girl. Hero of Power.
In her past life, she was the crown princess of Hyrule. Her mother died when she was 6, and her father, King Rhoam, threw himself into his duties in his grief. With the Prophecy, and the excavations unearthing the Divine Beasts and such, Zelda was forced to single-mindedly pursue awakening her "sealing power" by her ignorant father to the exclusion of even a moment's respite, and to the extreme detriment of her own well-being. He was an abusive cunt, to be frank, and his actions led directly to the fall of Hyrule.
In her new life, Zelda is an aspiring battlemage and scholar. She's fierce, driven, and takes no shit, while still remaining compassionate. She's the most passionate of the triad.

### Paya
Cis girl. Hero of Courage.
Her grandmother, Impa, was once Zelda's attendant and royal advisor. This gave Paya an overly-strong sense of tradition, to the point where it ended up stifling her as a person. After joining Zelda and Link on their travels, she loosens up and learns to strike a balance between tradition and growth -- in particular, she takes to both illusion and defensive magics with a will. While she does become a bit more outgoing, and is ever a fierce defender in battle, she's still the most shy of the triad.

Misc. Lines
---------
- Link and Zelda sat on the Master Cycle, gazing into the distance.
"It's 108 miles to the castle, we've got a full tank of gas, half a dozen fairies, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses." 
"Hit it."

- "We're on a mission from the Goddess," Zelda said seriously. 
"We're getting the band back together!" Link chirped gleefully.
Impa had never face-palmed so hard.
